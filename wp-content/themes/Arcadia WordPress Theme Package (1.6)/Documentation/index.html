				  <b>Thank you for purchasing my theme!</b>
				</p>
				<p>
				  This documentation will teach you how to use the Arcadia WordPress Theme.
				  <br/>I provide pretty extensive help in this file, but this doesn’t mean the theme is hard to use.
				  I just want to cover every question that might occur.
				  I also guide you from the installation process through theme specific functions to filling your page with content.
				</p>
				<p>
				  If questions occur that are not covered by this help file, feel free to ask your question in the comment section of this item.
				</p>
				<p>
				  Have fun with your new theme!

		<h3 id="folder-structure"><strong>A) Folder Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
		  Inside the theme folder you will find some folders that are for internal use only.
		  The folder that may be important to you is the folder <i>lib/frontend/</i>. 
		</p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>framework</strong> → internal universal classes and functions that are needed to make the theme run</li>
		  <li><strong>languages</strong> → folder for translation files</li>
		  <li><strong>lib</strong> → theme secific files
		    <ul>
		      <li><strong>backend</strong> → internal functions that are used by the admin panel</li>
		      <li><strong>frontend</strong> → files that are used for the layout
		        <ul>
		          <li><strong>fonts</strong> → font files that are used to display the <i>integrated fonts</i> with the <i>@font-face</i> method</li>
		          <li><strong>functions</strong> → functions that are needed for the frontend of the theme</li>
		          <li><strong>images</strong> → layout images and icons for the theme</li>
        		  <li><strong>javascripts</strong> → contains the jQuery Framework, Cufon files and jQuery plugins</li>
        		  <li><strong>plugins</strong> → contains additional jQuery plugins that are including files of different document types and theme plugins</li>
  		        <li><strong>stylesheets</strong> → just contains the <i>reset.css</i>. The main CSS code that styles the theme can be found in the root directory of the theme</li>
        		  <li><strong>templates</strong> → contains template files for the theme (e.g. code for different front page sliders)</li>
  		      </ul>
		      </li>
		      <li><strong>shared</strong> → functions that are used by the layout and the admin panel</li>
		    </ul>
		  </li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3 id="ins"><strong>B) Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h4 id="ins-wp">1) Installing WordPress</h4>
		
		<p>
		  If you are new to WordPress and haven't installed it on your server yet, I recommend to read the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">official WordPress installation instructions</a>.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h4 id="ins-theme">2) Installing the Theme</h4>
		
		<p>
		  You can either install the theme by uploading it from the admin panel, which is the easiest method, or you can upload it via FTP to your server.
		  Some hosting companies restrict the upload size of files, so if the first method doesn't work, please try the second one (via FTP).
		  Here are the steps for both methods:
		</p>
		
		<h5 id="ins-theme">Installing the Theme via Upload from the Admin Panel</h5>
		
		<ol>
		  <li>Unzip the package you've downloaded from ThemeForest</li>
		  <li>Log in to your WordPress admin panel</li>
		  <li>Go to <i>Apparance → Theme</i> and click the tab called <i>Install Themes</i> (on top of the page)</li>
		  <li>Now click the <i>upload</i> link and click the button <i>Choose File</i></li>
		  <li>In the dialog window, navigate to the folder that you just unzipped and double click the file <i>Arcadia.zip</i></li>
		  <li>Now click on <i>Install Now</i></li>
		  <li>Wait till you see the message <i>Theme installed successfully</i></li>
		  <li>Click the <i>Activate</i> link and you'll find yourself in the theme settings - <b>it's done!</b></li>
		</ol>
		
		<h5 id="ins-theme">Installing the Theme via FTP (in case it doesn't work via the Admin Panel)</h5>
		
		<ol>
		  <li>Unzip the package you've downloaded from ThemeForest</li>
		  <li>In the unzipped folder, unzip the file <i>Arcadia.zip</i></li>
		  <li>Open your FTP program and log on to your server (if you don't have an FTP program, I'd recommend <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a></li>
		  <li>On the server, navigate in your WordPress installation to the directory <i>/wp-content/themes</i></li>
		  <li>Now upload the folder called <i>Arcadia</i>, that you just unzipped, into this directory</li>
		  <li>When the upload is complete, log in to your WordPress admin panel</li>
		  <li>Go to <i>Apparance → Theme</i></li>
		  <li>Here you should see the Arcadia Theme</li>
		  <li>Click the <i>Activate</i> link and you'll find yourself in the theme settings - <b>it's done!</b></li>
		</ol>
		
		<p class="box">
		  <b>Notice:</b> If you should've trouble with the theme installation, I recommend to read the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Using_Themes">official WordPress Theme installation instructions</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Now we can start to fill your site with content and then set up some options for the theme.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3 id="setup"><strong>C) Setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<h4 id="setup-import">1) Import Dummy Content</h4>
		
		<p>
		  In the unzipped folder of the file you've got from ThemeForest, you'll find another folder called <i>Dummy Content</i>.
      In there you'll find the file <i>dummy_content.xml</i>.
      Here are the steps to import this file into WordPress, so you can have an easier start:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
		  <li>Log in to your WordPress admin panel</li>
		  <li>Go to <i>Tools → Import</i></li>
		  <li>Click the link that reads <i>WordPress</i> in the tables last row</li>
		  <li>On the next screen with the title <i>Import WordPress</i>, click the button <i>Choose File</i></li>
		  <li>In the dialog window, navigate to the unzipped theme folder and then into the folder <i>Dummy Content</i>, where you double click the file <i>dummy_content.xml</i></li>
		  <li>Now click the button <i>Upload file and import</i></li>
		  <li>On the next screen I recommend to assign the imported posts to an existing user (with the select menu) and to activate the checkbox called <i>Download and import file attachments</i></li>
		  <li>After you click <i>submit</i> you should get an <i>All done</i> message :)</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h4 id="setup-theme-settings">2) Basic Theme Settings</h4>
		
		<p>
		  Arcadia has a lot of admin options.
		  But don't worry - you don't have to go through all of them to make the theme work.
		  In fact, the theme works right out of the box. There are just a few things you have to set up to get your Front Page, Blog and Portfolio going.
		  Basically, you just need to create 3 new pages (<i>Pages → Add New</i>): one for the Front Page, one for the Blog and one for the Portfolio.
		  If you imported the dummy content you'll already have these pages and you can jump right into the options:
		</p>
		
		<h5 id="setup-front-page">Setup Front Page</h5>
		<ol>
		  <li>Go to <i>Theme Options → Front Page</i></li>
		  <li>Select the page <i>Front Page</i> from the select menu under the options <i>Select Content Page</i></li>
		  <li>Click the button <i>Save Changes</i> (on the bottom of the page)</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h5 id="setup-blog">Setup Blog</h5>
		<ol>
		  <li>Go to <i>Theme Options → Blog</i></li>
		  <li>Select the page <i>Blog</i> from the select menu under the options <i>Select Blog Page</i></li>
		  <li>Click the button <i>Save Changes</i> (on the bottom of the page)</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h5 id="setup-portfolio">Setup Portfolio</h5>
		<ol>
		  <li>Go to <i>Theme Options → Portfolio</i></li>
		  <li>Select the page <i>Portfolio</i> from the select menu under the options <i>Select Portfolio Page</i></li>
		  <li>Now select the categories of which you want portfolio entries on your page</li>
		  <li>Click the button <i>Save Changes</i> (on the bottom of the page)</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3 id="content"><strong>D) Adding Content</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h4 id="content-custom-menus">1) Custom Menu</h4>
		
	  <p class="box">
	    <b>Notice:</b> If you've never worked with the Menu Manager before, I recommend reading the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Menus_Screen">WordPress Codex Page about Menus</a>.
	  </p>
	  
		<p>
		  I highly recommend to create a custom menu for the main navigation, because else, WordPress will automatically add every new page that you create to the main navigation and it can easily "overflow".
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  To create a custom menu, do the following steps:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
		  <li>Go to <i>Appeance → Menus</i></li>
		  <li>Enter a menu name (e.g. "Main") and hit <i>Create Menu</i></li>
		  <li>In the panel <i>Theme Locations</i> under <i>Main Menu</i>, select your newly created menu (e.g. "Main") and hit <i>Save</i></li>
		  <li>Now you can start adding menu items from the panels on the left side of the screen</li>
		  <li>Hit <i>Save Menu</i> when you're done adding items</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
		  As you might have noticed, there are two more locations in the panel <i>Theme Locations</i> called <i>Header Bar Menu</i> and <i>Footer Bar Menu</i>.
		  By clicking the <i><b>+</b></i> tab you can add more custom menus and add them to these locations.
		  The options for the header and footer bars can be found under <i>Theme Options → Info Bars</i>.
		  There you can pick what type of content to show in the info bars.
		  And under <i>Theme Options → Layout</i> you can decide if the info bars should be displayed at all.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h4 id="content-adding">2) Adding Posts, Pages and Portfolio Entries</h4>
		
		<p>
		  The options for Posts, Pages and Portfolio Items are almost the same.
		  The theme adds some extra panels called <i>Featured Content Replacements</i> (will be described below) and <i>Template Options</i>, to change the page content size (sidebar or full width), the sidebar position (left or right), the sidebar style (default or wide), the sidebar (that you can add in <i>Theme Options → Sidebars</i> and fill with widgets in <i>Apperance → Widgets</i> and, for Portfolio Entries, the link to external websites (which displays a <i>Visit Site</i> link next to the <i>Read More</i> link).
		</p>
		
		<h5 id="content-excerpt">How to set an excerpt</h5>
		
		<p>
		  You can set excerpts in 3 different ways.
		  By default an excerpt of 55 words is created for overview pages.
		  You can change this in <i>Theme Options → Blog</i> and <i>Theme Options → Portfolio</i>.
		  You can either chose that the excerpt is automatically created or that you want to set it by yourself by setting a <i>More Tag</i> in your text or by writing the excerpt in the excerpt panel.
		  If you prefer to write a summary of your post in the excerpt panel you might have to activate it first.
		  To do that, click the <i>Screen Options</i> tab on the top right corner of your screen and set a check mark on <i>Excerpt</i>.
		  For Portfolio items I would always recommend to do it this way, since you can write a quick summary about the item separate from the text.
		</p>
		
		<h5 id="content-featured-image">How to set a featured image</h5>
		
		<p>
		  <img src="assets/images/featured-image_1.png" class="right" />
		  The panel for the <i>Featured Image</i> is on the bottom right.
		  Click the link <i>Set featured image</i> to let the media library appear.
		  Upload or choose an image and click <i>Use as featured image</i> (not <i>Intert into Post</i>).
		  Don't worry if the scale of your image is too big, because the theme automatically downsizes the image to fit.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<h5 id="content-replace-featured-image">How to replace the featured image for certain areas</h5>
		
		<p>
		  <img src="assets/images/featured-content-replacement-panel.png" width="400" class="right" />
		</p>
		<p>
		  A panel called <i>Featured Content Replacement</i> is located directly under your editor.
		  Here you can overwrite the <i>Featured Image</i> for certain areas.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  For example: if you want to show a different image on the single post than the <i>Featured Image</i> that is displayed in your blog / post overview, paste the URL to your image of choice into the <i>Overview</i> field.
		  <br/>
		  Or if you want to show a videos instead of the <i>Featured Image</i> in the Lightbox, paste the link into the <i>Lightbox</i> field.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  To get the URL you can also simply click on the <i>Set Content</i> button to make the media library appear.
		  Select your image and click the <i>Insert into Post</i> button.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  You can also set the resize method for the content with the select menus under the content input fields.
		  If you leave the option <i>Inherit Size from Image Options</i> on, the images will adapt the size you've set in the theme options for the specific post type.
		  <br/>
		  For example: if you edit a blog post and set a replacement image or video with the resize method <i>Inherit Size from Image Options</i>, it will scale the image or video exactly after the <i>Featured Image Size</i> settings you've entered under <i>Theme Options → Blog</i>.
		</p>
		
		
		<h5 id="content-lightbox">How to set videos and images as Lightbox content</h5>
		
		<p>
		  If you set a <i>Featured Image</i>, the lightbox will automatically display a big version of the image.
		  But if you want to change the lightbox image into something else or even display a video instead, you have to paste the URL to the image or video into the <i>Lightbox</i> field.
		  Please be aware that the <i>Lightbox</i> field is the only field besides the others where you <b>don't</b> have to paste in the video embedding code.
		  Just paste in the URL to the video and the theme will figure out the rest.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Here are some examples of how the URL could look like:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
		  <li><strong>Vimeo Video:</strong> http://vimeo.com/16369165</li>
		  <li><strong>YouTube Video:</strong> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JAyaBuOYyY</li>
		  <li><strong>Resized Vimeo Video:</strong> http://vimeo.com/16369165?width=800&height=450</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
		  Noticed something in the last URL example?
		  Yes, you can even set the size of the video by adding some URL parameters to the video URL (e.g. <b>?width=800&height=450</b>).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  You can find more examples on the homepage of the lightbox creator:
		  <br/><a href="http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/">http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/</a>
		</p>
		
		
		<h5 id="content-embed-videos">How to embed videos correctly</h5>
		
		<p>
		  <img src="assets/images/youtube-embed.png" width="360" class="left" />
		  In the <i>Featured Content Replacement</i> panel you have the option to embed videos in the fields <b><i>Overview</i></b> and <b><i>Entry</i></b>.
		  You get the embed code on the video portal websites.
		  <br/>E.g. on YouTube you just have to click <i>Share → Embed</i> under the video, and then copy and paste the embed code into the field.
		  The width and height of the video don't have to be adjusted, because the theme will resize the video automatically.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Only in case you want to embed a video into the content (Visual or HTML editor) instead of the featured area, you have to set the right size.
		  For a page that has a sidebar that would be 600 pixel width and for a full width page (without sidebar) it's 900 pixel width (the height gets adjusted automatically).
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h4 id="content-slider">3) Adding Slider and Featured Items to the Front Page</h4>
		
		<p>
		  <img src="assets/images/slider-options.png" class="right" />
		  To add slider or featured items to the front page you first have to set what slider or feature area you want to see on the front page.
		  You can do this by going to <i>Theme Options → Front Page</i> and select a method from the select menu in the <i>Slider / Feature</i> panel.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  If you haven't choosen <i>Static Content / Video</i> (which can be set directly in the <i>Front Page</i> settings), please navigate now to <i>Featured Items → Add New</i>.
		  Here you need to set a <i>Featured Image</i> and a title.
		  The rest is optional.
		  <br/>
		  Depending on the slider or feature area you've picked, you'll see options like <i>Description</i> and <i>Featured Item Link</i> and in some cases even a whole panel with more slider settings (e.g. <i>Caption Position</i> [to position the description text as caption] or <i>Read More Link</i> [to change the text of the read more link]</i>.
		  So please check out these options, after you changed the slider in the <i>Front Page</i> options.
		  The possibilities might surprise you ;)
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		<h4 id="content-disable-comments">4) Disable Comments for Posts or Pages</h4>
		
		<p>
		  To disable comments for all <b>new</b> posts and pages, go to <i>Settings → Discussion</i> and uncheck the box <i>Allow people to post comments on new articles</i>.
		  Please note that this only disables for <b>new</b> posts and pages.
		  The ones you already have, need to be disabled manually.
		  <br/>
		  To do this, please follow these steps:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
		  <li>Go to edit the post or page you want to disable the comment on</li>
		  <li>On the top right of your window you'll see a little tab called <i>Screen Options</i> that you click</li>
		  <li>In the roll-down area, check the box <i>Discussion</i> if it is not already checked</li>
		  <li>Now scroll down and you should see a panel called <i>Discussion</i> below the other panels</li>
		  <li>In this panel uncheck the box <i>Allow comments</i> and you're done!</li>
		</ol>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3 id="sc"><strong>E) Shortcodes</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>
		  Shortcodes in Arcadia are as easy as pie.
		  When ever you edit a page or post, look for the little yellow flash icon in the toolbar of the visual editor.
		  One click on it reveals a menu of all the shortcodes you can insert into your page.
		  Just choose the one you need...
		</p>
		
		<div class="span-10">
		  <img src="assets/images/sc_1.png" width="100%" />
		</div>
		
		<div class="span-10 last">
		  <img src="assets/images/sc_2.png" width="100%" />
		</div>
		
		<div class="clear clearfix"></div>
		
		<p>
		  <img src="assets/images/sc_3.png" width="450" class="border with-padding right" />
		  Some shortcodes offer you an options form to configure the output.
		  Some of these forms might seem extensive, but please keep in mind that the most options are optional and don't have to be set.
		  Required fields are marked <b>bold</b> (like the first option <i>Blockquote</i> in the screenshot).
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3 id="child-theme"><strong>F) Modifying the Theme with a Child Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>
		  Over are the dark old days where you had to modify the theme directly to make some changes, but then weren't able to update it anymore.
		  <br/>
		  Arcadia is a robust parent theme, so if you want to change functions, classes or template files, all you have to do is to create a child theme and overwrite the already existing function.
		  This way the original theme stays untouched and you can preform updates without worrying that your code gets lost.
		  I even created a child theme skeleton to make the process even easier for you.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Just upload the ZIP file that is in the theme package folder <i>Child Theme Skeleton</i> the same way as it is stated in the section <a href="#ins">Installing the Theme</a>.
		  After you activate your child theme you will be able to operate inside this theme and all changes will be applied to Arcadia.
		</p>
		
		<p class="box">
		  <b>Notice:</b> If you've never worked with child themes before I recommend reading the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">WordPress Codex page about child themes</a>.
		  Turst me, you'll get it easy and it is well worth the efford :)
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<h3 id="translating"><strong>G) Translating the Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>
		  Arcadia is complete translation ready.
		  Whithin the theme files you'll find a folder called <i>languages</i>.
		  This is where your translation files go.
		  German, Dutch, French and Spanish are already included, but by default the theme speaks english.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Here are the steps to create a translation file for another language:
		</p>
		
		<ol>
		  <li>Download a gettext file editor like <a href="http://www.poedit.net/">poedit</a> and install it.</li>
		  <li>Open Poedit and select <i>File → New Catalog from POT file...</i></li>
		  <li>In the dialog window, navigate to your theme files into the folder <i>languages</i> and double click the file <i>arcadia.pot</i></li>
		  <li>On the next window that pops up you can give your catalog a name and a version (e.g. "Arcadia Swedish 1.0"), select a language, a country and two charsets (should be set to <i>UTF-8</i>)</li>
		  <li>After you hit <i>OK</i>, Poedit will open a new save dialog window and you should save you new translation file into the <i>languages</i> folder and name it after the appropriate country code (e.g. "de_DE.po")</li>
		  <li>Now you can start translating</li>
		  <li>Hit <i>Save</i> when you're done</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p class="box">
		  <b>Notice:</b>
		  If you're not sure what country code to use, you can also check it in the file <i>wp-config.php</i> in the WordPress root directory.
		  Just open the file and search for the line <code>define('WPLANG', '');</code> (should be around line 72).
		  By default (if nothing is set) the country code is <i>en_US</i>, but you can also set it manually, e.g. to <code>define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');</code>.
		  This would, of course invoke the file <i>de_DE.po</i>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  If you have WordPress already installed in the language you've translated your theme to, the translation should kick right in.
		  If it doesn't, make sure to install WordPress in the right language or change the WordPress language manually (as described in the notice box above).
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
      <h3 id="updating"><strong>H) Updating the Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
  		
  		<p>
  		  There are two ways to update the theme.
  		  You can either the use the <a href="https://github.com/envato/envato-wordpress-toolkit/downloads">Envato WordPress Toolkit</a> plugin and update Arcadia (and all other ThemeForest themes) through WordPress' admin panel, or you can do it manually by using an FTP client.
  		</p>
  		
  		<p>
  		  Here I describe both ways:
  		</p>
  		
  		
  		
  		
  		<h4 id="updating_1">1) Automatic Updates</h4>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/envato/envato-wordpress-toolkit">Envato WordPress Toolkit</a> plugin.</li>
        <li>Upload the <i>envato-wordpress-toolkit</i> folder to the <i>/wp-content/plugins/</i> directory on your server.</li>
        <li>Activate the plugin through the <i>Plugins</i> menu in WordPress.</li>
        <li>
          To establish a ThemeForest API connection, navigate to the <i>Envato Toolkit</i> page and insert your ThemeForest username and secret API key in the designated input fields.
          To obtain your API Key, visit your <i>My Settings</i> page on ThemeForest.
        </li>
        <li>
          After clicking <i>Save Settings</i>, you should see all ThemeForest themes you have installed.
          If an update is available, you'll see a message below the theme and you can click on <i>update automatically</i>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      
      
      
  		<h4 id="updating_2">2) Manual Updates</h4>
  		
  		
      <p>
        A manual update requires you to re-download and re-install the theme on your WordPress installation.
        But don't worry.
        None of your theme settings will get lost (they are stored in the database and not in the theme files).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To get notified about updates, you should add me on your social networks:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/113894971444572788458/">My Google+ profile</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ruven/115129975163761">My Facebook profile</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/_ruven">My Twitter profile</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Please follow these steps to update the theme:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Re-download the theme package from ThemeForest in <i>My Account → Downloads</i> (here you can also rate the theme).</li>
        <li>Log in to your WordPress admin panel.</li>
  		  <li>Go to <i>Apparance → Theme</i> and deactivate the current <i>Arcadia</i> theme by temporarily <b>activating</b> the default theme <i>Twenty Eleven</i>.</li>
  		  <li>Under <i>Available Themes</i>, on the deactivated <i>Arcadia</i> theme, click on <i>Delete</i> to remove it.</li>
  		  <li>To upload the new version of the theme, just follow the <a href="#ins">installation instructions from above</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p class="box">
        <b>Notice:</b> If you have ever modified any theme files directly, I assume you have a local copy of them on your computer.
        If you don't, please login to your WordPress installation via FTP and backup the old theme files, before you remove them from the server.
        Please note that these modifications will be lost after the update.
        Child Themes are the right choice to modify theme files without losing the code after an update (you can read about them <a href="#child-theme">here</a>).
      </p>

      Since the theme supports extensive options to change the image sizes, you can change the height of almost all of them within the admin panel.

		<h3 id="css"><strong>J) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>      The CSS code structure is pretty simple. 
      In every CSS file you will find headlines that tell you what the following code is about.
      <br/><br/>      <strong>Technical Note:</strong>
      In front of every headline is the word <i>@group</i>.
      This is a special tag, that is used by some CSS-Editors in order to let you navigate through your code faster by the use of a tree view where every group gets displayed as a folder.

		<h3 id="photoshop"><strong>K) Photoshop Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>
		  Among with the theme come all PSD files needed to edit the different layout styles and colors. With these files you can even create your own unique layout style.

  		This theme makes use of the jQuery JavaScript Framework and contains plugins that are written with the frameworks syntax.
  		Further the theme is using the font replacement engine Cufon.    </p>

      <br/>Most of the JavaScript files can be found in the directory <i>lib/frontend/javascript</i>.
      The files of plugins that require more than just a JavaScript file are located in the directory <i>lib/frontend/plugins</i>.

		<h5>Plugin Settings and Custom JavaScript</h5>
		
		<p>
		  To change the settings of a plugin, simply edit the <i>script.js</i> file inside the <i>javascript</i> folder.
